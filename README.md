# GHG Emission Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions using Machine Learning models based on multiple environmental and industrial factors. It is aimed at helping policymakers and environmentalists analyze trends and make data-driven decisions to mitigate climate change.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a predictive ML model that accurately estimates GHG emissions using a dataset containing environmental and economic indicators like energy consumption, population, industrial output, and more.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- (Optional: Add any other models you’ve used)
